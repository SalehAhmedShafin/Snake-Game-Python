# Snake-Game-Python
Welcome to the Basic Snake Game in Python! In this simple yet engaging game, you'll take control of a snake and navigate it around the screen, trying to eat food and grow in length. Your goal is to achieve the highest score possible without colliding with the walls or your own body.

The game utilizes the Pygame library, which provides a set of tools and functionalities for game development. Pygame allows us to handle graphics, input events, and game logic, making it a perfect choice for creating this snake game.

At the beginning of the game, you'll see a rectangular game window with a snake and a piece of food. The snake starts with a single segment, and as it eats the food, it grows longer. The arrow keys on your keyboard control the snake's movement: up, down, left, and right.

You must guide the snake to the food by changing its direction appropriately. As the snake eats the food, its length increases, and the score increments. However, be cautious! If the snake collides with the walls or its own body, it's game over. At that point, the game will display a "Game Over" message, and you can restart by closing and rerunning the program.

The game implements basic collision detection, keyboard input handling, and game rendering. It also includes a game loop that continuously updates the game state, checks for collisions, and redraws the screen. The snake's movement and growth, as well as the appearance of food, are all controlled within this loop.

Feel free to modify and expand upon this basic snake game as you wish. You can enhance it by adding features like levels, obstacles, or power-ups to make it more challenging and exciting. So, let's dive in, control the snake, and see how high you can score in this classic and addictive game!
